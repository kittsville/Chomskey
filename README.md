# Chomskey - Online Keyboard Layouts

>[Chomsky speaks to you, his chosen ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOROvO2fxTc)

Can't install a keyboard layout on your system? Have no fear! Chomskey allows you to create a custom keyboard layout (or choose from common layouts) then type away! Chomskey comes with [UCL's IPA keyboard layout](http://kittsville.github.io/Chomskey/#ucl-ipa), for the linguist on the go.

Powered by Magic Dust and jQuery.

### FAQ

Q. Why make this?

A. It started with my boyfriend (a linguist) mentioning the problem of doing work at uni when there isn't a keyboard layout installed that lets you type IPA symbols. While there's [this](http://westonruter.github.io/ipa-chart/keyboard/) amazing tool it doesn't have the same ease of typing with [UCL's IPA keyboard layout](http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/phonetics/) installed.

Q. Why call it Chomskey?

A. I thought up the pun 'Chomskey' while browsing [/r/badlinguistics](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics) in the summer of 2015. The desire to annoy people with terrible puns combined with the desire to help people with useful applications. A week of intense coding and logo design later and Chomskey was born.

Q. Really?

A. Yes, really.
