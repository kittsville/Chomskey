To contribute to Chomskey you'll need a web stack. You won't need a database but
you'll need something to respond to HTTP requests. I've always used XAMP on
Windows because it's idiot (me) proof but if you use Linux you may well have Apache
packaged with your install. Just follow any instructions on setting up a site via
your preferred stack and dump Chomskey in your htdocs/html_public directory.

If you're getting the no jQuery error then most likely:
1. You didn't read the above paragraph.
2. You need to allow Cross-domain Requests to Google's CDN so jQuery can be loaded.
   Read up on CORS - it's interesting stuff.
I'm open to pestering at kittsville@gmail.com with Chomskey related problems
but do try to Google things first.

If you're curious about the Chomsky/Zardoz stuff all over this app then check out
/r/badlinguistics or watch the film Zardoz (1974).
